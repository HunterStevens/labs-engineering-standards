Rationale:

- We restrict the programming languages and frameworks in Lambda Labs so that
  we can focus our resources on a subset of available technologies. By
  narrowing the field of choices, we feel that product quality will be improved
  through the sharing of common knowledge and reusable components.

Exceptions:

- None
