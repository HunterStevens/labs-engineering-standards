## (AW-100) Approved AWS Services

The only permitted AWS services for Lambda School Labs projects are listed below:

-   Amplify
    -   Front-end hosting of Single Page Apps (SPA) only
-   Elastic Beanstalk
    -   Data Science API deployments only
-   Sagemaker
    -   Data Science only
-   S3
    -   Public asset storage
    -   User uploads via signed URLs
    -   Data storage for DS teams

All others are prohibited from use.

Note: These services utilize many underlying services, which are permitted only
when provisioned by the orchestration services listed above.

Rationale:

-   AWS is _very_ deep, with many different services and components. That complexity
    needs careful controls to reduce risk and cost.

Alternatives:

-   None

Exceptions:

-   None
