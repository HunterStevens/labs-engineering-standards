# Overview

This document describes the engineering standards that teams working in Lambda X
must comply with. Adherence to these standards are critical to the continued
success of the Lambda X organization, as they allow us to more effectively
manage the scores of teams working across hundreds of products.

## Topics

This guide is divided into separate topics, saved here in Notion as pages.
A topic corresponds to a specific area of concern in software engineering. The
topics can all be viewed in the menu at the top of the page.

## Standards

The standards in this guide do not cover all choices in technology. Many are
purposely omitted as they are not considered impactful to the quality of the
overall program.

However, this guide is exclusive, in that if a technology choice
is _not_ mentioned as part of a topic, you can assume the use of that technology
is prohibited. When in doubt, please open an issue or submit a PR to start
a discussion.

## Contributing

These standards will morph over time as we adapt to the ever-changing technology
landscape. In addition, the stardards will embrace a subset of all of the
available technologies, so that teams have options when making technical
decisions. To in order to ensure that these documents are inclusive of the needs
of all Labs groups, each new standard or change to an existing standard will be
ratified by approval from 3 Labs Tech Leads.

### Setup your local enviornment

!!! Info
    All steps below are based on the use of [pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/)

    - on mac: `> brew install pipenv`

    The github actions still require a `requirements.txt` file so if you add anything
    to the `Pipfile` you will also need to add it to the `requirements.txt` file.

1. Install all dependancies and setup a python virtual env
    - `> pipenv install --dev`
2. Start a pipenv shell
    - `> pipenv shell`
3. Run the mkdocs server to build and view you local changes
    - `> mkdocs serve`
    - Now open browser to `http://localhost:8000`
4. install markdown linter
    - `> npm install -g markdownlint-cli`
5. Run the markdown linter before commiting
    - `> markdownlint -c .markdownlint.json .`

    !!! Warning
        be aware that `mkdocs serve` serves the files directly from the docs
        fold and does not build the `site` folder as `mkdocs build` does.
        This means that relative paths may cause a warning.
